# Python String Formatting

    The formatting operations described here (<b>% operator</b>) exhibit a variety of quirks that lead to a number of common errors [...]. Using the newer <a href="#formatted-string-literals-or-f-strings">formatted string literals</a> [...] helps avoid these errors. These alternatives also provide more powerful, flexible and extensible approaches to formatting text.

## % operator

  <base-warning-content>
    For new code, using <a href="#strformat">str.format</a>, or <a href="#formatted-string-literals-or-f-strings">formatted string literals</a> (Python 3.6+) over the <code>%</code> operator is strongly recommended.

```python
>>> name = 'Pete'
>>> 'Hello %s' % name
# "Hello Pete"
```

We can use the `%x` format specifier to convert an int value to a string:

```python
>>> num = 5
>>> 'I have %x apples' % num
# "I have 5 apples"
```

## str.format

Python 3 introduced a new way to do string formatting that was later back-ported to Python 2.7. This makes the syntax for string formatting more regular.

```python
>>> name = 'John'
>>> age = 20'

>>> "Hello I'm {}, my age is {}".format(name, age)
# "Hello I'm John, my age is 20"

>>> "Hello I'm {0}, my age is {1}".format(name, age)
# "Hello I'm John, my age is 20"
```

## Formatted String Literals or f-strings

If your are using Python 3.6+, string `f-strings` are the recommended way to format strings.

<base-disclaimer>
  <base-disclaimer-title>
    From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings">Python 3 documentation</a>
  </base-disclaimer-title>
  <base-disclaimer-content>
    A formatted string literal or f-string is a string literal that is prefixed with `f` or `F`. These strings may contain replacement fields, which are expressions delimited by curly braces {}. While other string literals always have a constant value, formatted strings are really expressions evaluated at run time.

```python
>>> name = 'Elizabeth'
>>> f'Hello {name}!'
# 'Hello Elizabeth!'
```

It is even possible to do inline arithmetic with it:

```python
>>> a = 5
>>> b = 10
>>> f'Five plus ten is {a + b} and not {2 * (a + b)}.'
# 'Five plus ten is 15 and not 30.'
```

## Formatting digits

Adding thousands separator

```python
>>> a = 10000000
>>> print({0:,}.format(a))
# 10,000,000
```

Rounding

```python
>>> a = 3.1415926
>>> print("{0:.2f}".format(a))
# 3.14
```

Showing as Percentage

```python
>>> a = 0.816562
>>> print("{0:.2%}".format(a))
# 81.66%
```

## Template Strings

A simpler and less powerful mechanism, but it is recommended when handling strings generated by users. Due to their reduced complexity, template strings are a safer choice.

```python
>>> from string import Template
>>> name = 'Elizabeth'
>>> t = Template('Hey $name!')
>>> t.substitute(name=name)
# 'Hey Elizabeth!'
```
